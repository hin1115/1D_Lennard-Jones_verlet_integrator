# 1D_Lennard-Jones_verlet_integrator
This is a code for fundamental Molecule Dynamics.

You can run the 'ipynb' file for 1D Lennard-Jones potential Velocity verlet integrator for Argon gas.   

It follows the approach in https://pythoninchemistry.org/sim_and_scat/molecular_dynamics/intro.html   

And follows more details in https://nznano.blogspot.com/2017/11/molecular-dynamics-in-python.html
